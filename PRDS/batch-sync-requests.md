# PRD: Batch Sync Requests

## Problem Statement
Current sync operations are performed individually, which can be inefficient for users with many verses or poor network conditions.

## Requirements
### Performance Goals
- Reduce network round trips
- Improve sync reliability in poor network conditions
- Better user experience during bulk operations
- Maintain data consistency

### Batch Operations
- Batch verse creations
- Batch review submissions
- Batch profile updates
- Smart batching based on network conditions

## Technical Approach
### Implementation Strategy
- Create batch endpoints in edge functions
- Queue system for offline operations
- Intelligent batching based on operation type
- Retry logic for failed batches
- Progress indicators for large sync operations

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface BatchSyncRequest {
  operations: Array<{
    type: 'create_verse' | 'record_review' | 'update_profile';
    data: any;
    localId: string;
  }>;
  timestamp: string;
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple operations batched into single requests
- Graceful handling of partial failures
- Proper error reporting for individual operations
- Improved sync performance for bulk operations
- Maintains existing dual-write pattern benefits

## Priority
Medium
