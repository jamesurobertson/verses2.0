# PRD: Property-Level Multi-Device Sync with Smart Conflict Resolution

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-03  
**Status:** Recommended Implementation  
**Priority:** P1 (Post-MVP)
**Development Stage:** Greenfield - No Migration Required

## Executive Summary

Current timestamp-based sync creates data loss when users review verses on multiple devices simultaneously. This PRD outlines a property-level sync architecture inspired by Dexie Cloud that resolves conflicts using business logic while maintaining simplicity and performance.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Data Loss in Conflicts:** "Last write wins" discards valid user progress
- **Race Conditions:** Simultaneous reviews on different devices cause inconsistent state
- **Broken Streaks:** Offline devices can reset streaks when syncing stale data
- **Phase Regression:** Device A advances to weekly phase, Device B's sync reverts to daily

### Real-World Scenarios
1. **Morning Phone, Evening Tablet:** User reviews John 3:16 successfully on phone (9am), then unsuccessfully on tablet (8pm). Current system: tablet's failure overwrites phone's success.

2. **Commute Conflicts:** User completes 14th daily review on phone (offline train), reaches weekly phase. At home, reviews same verse on tablet with stale data. Current system: tablet sync regresses user back to daily phase.

3. **Family Sharing:** Multiple family members use shared account on different devices, creating complex conflict scenarios.

## Proposed Solution: Property-Level Sync with Smart Conflict Resolution

### Core Architecture

**Property-Level Updates + Business-Aware Conflict Resolution**
- Track individual property changes with device context and timestamps
- Resolve conflicts using business rules specific to each property type
- Maintain atomic transactions for related property updates
- Use globally unique IDs to prevent creation conflicts

### Key Components

#### 1. Property-Level Change Tracking
```javascript
// Instead of replacing entire objects
{ phase: 'weekly', progress: 2, streak: 15, last_reviewed: '2025-08-03T14:00Z' }

// Track individual property changes
{
  property_updates: [
    { 
      property: 'last_reviewed', 
      value: '2025-08-03T09:00Z', 
      device_id: 'phone-abc123',
      timestamp: '2025-08-03T09:01Z'
    },
    { 
      property: 'current_streak', 
      value: 15, 
      device_id: 'phone-abc123',
      timestamp: '2025-08-03T09:01Z',
      conflict_resolution: 'max_value'
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Business-Aware Conflict Resolution Rules
**By Property Type:**
- **last_reviewed_at**: Most recent successful review wins
- **current_streak**: Higher value wins (success preserves streaks)
- **current_phase**: Progression wins over regression (weekly > daily)
- **phase_progress_count**: Higher progress wins within same phase
- **best_streak**: Always take maximum value across devices

#### 3. Atomic Transaction Groups
```javascript
// Review outcome affects multiple properties atomically
transaction: [
  { property: 'last_reviewed_at', value: timestamp },
  { property: 'current_streak', value: streak + 1 },
  { property: 'phase_progress_count', value: progress + 1 },
  { property: 'current_phase', value: 'weekly' } // if advanced
]
// All succeed or all rollback
```

## Technical Implementation

### ðŸš€ **Greenfield Advantage: Direct Schema Updates**

**No Migration Required** - This is a new product with no existing users. We can update the core schema directly in the migration files rather than creating complex migration scripts.

### Database Schema Changes

#### Updated verse_cards Table (Direct Schema Modification)
```sql
-- Enhanced verse_cards table with built-in property-level tracking
CREATE TABLE public.verse_cards (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    verse_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.verses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
    -- Core spaced repetition fields
    current_phase text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'daily' 
        CHECK (current_phase IN ('daily', 'weekly', 'biweekly', 'monthly')),
    phase_progress_count integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_reviewed_at timestamp with time zone,
    next_due_date date NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    assigned_day_of_week integer CHECK (assigned_day_of_week BETWEEN 1 AND 7),
    assigned_week_parity integer CHECK (assigned_week_parity IN (0, 1)),
    assigned_day_of_month integer CHECK (assigned_day_of_month BETWEEN 1 AND 28),
    archived boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    current_streak integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    best_streak integer DEFAULT 0,
    
    -- Property-level tracking fields (NEW)
    device_id text,
    last_reviewed_device text,
    last_reviewed_timestamp timestamp with time zone,
    current_streak_device text,
    current_streak_timestamp timestamp with time zone,
    current_phase_device text,
    current_phase_timestamp timestamp with time zone,
    phase_progress_device text,
    phase_progress_timestamp timestamp with time zone,
    
    -- Standard timestamps
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

#### New Device Tracking Table
```sql
-- Simple device identification
devices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  device_fingerprint TEXT NOT NULL,
  device_name TEXT,
  last_sync_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, device_fingerprint)
);
```

#### Property Change Log (Optional - for debugging)
```sql
-- Audit trail for property changes
property_changes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  verse_card_id UUID REFERENCES verse_cards(id),
  property_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  old_value TEXT,
  new_value TEXT,
  device_id TEXT,
  conflict_resolved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  resolution_strategy TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### LocalDB Changes

#### Enhanced Services
```javascript
// Property-level update tracking
propertySync: {
  async updateProperty(verseCardId, property, value, deviceId)
  async getPropertyConflicts(verseCardId, property)
  async resolvePropertyConflict(verseCardId, property, strategy)
  async getPropertyHistory(verseCardId, property)
}

// Device management
deviceService: {
  async getOrCreateDevice(fingerprint, name?)
  async updateLastSync(deviceId)
  async getDeviceStats(userId)
}

// Enhanced conflict resolution
conflictResolver: {
  async detectPropertyConflicts(verseCardId)
  async resolveByBusinessRules(conflicts[])
  async applyResolution(verseCardId, resolutions[])
}

// Atomic transaction support
transactionService: {
  async executePropertyTransaction(updates[])
  async rollbackTransaction(transactionId)
  async validateTransaction(updates[])
}
```

### API Changes

#### Enhanced Sync Endpoints
```javascript
// Property-level sync
POST /api/sync/properties
{
  deviceId: "device-fingerprint",
  propertyUpdates: [
    {
      verseCardId: "uuid",
      property: "current_streak",
      value: 15,
      timestamp: "2025-08-03T09:00Z",
      conflictResolution: "max_value"
    }
  ],
  lastSyncTimestamp: "2025-08-03T08:00Z"
}

// Get property changes since last sync
GET /api/sync/properties?since=timestamp&deviceId=fingerprint

// Automatic conflict resolution
POST /api/sync/resolve
{
  verseCardId: "uuid",
  conflicts: [
    {
      property: "current_streak",
      localValue: 14,
      remoteValue: 15,
      strategy: "max_value"
    }
  ]
}
```

## User Experience Impact

### Transparent to Users
- **No UI changes required** - users see same computed state
- **Automatic conflict resolution** - happens silently in background
- **Preserved progress** - no more lost reviews or reset streaks

### Enhanced Capabilities  
- **Audit trail** - "Why did my streak reset?" can be answered
- **Undo operations** - theoretical ability to rollback specific actions
- **Cross-device insights** - analytics on multi-device usage patterns

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation** - falls back to timestamp sync if tree resolution fails
- **Manual resolution UI** - for complex conflicts that need user input
- **Sync health indicators** - show users when devices are out of sync

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Conflict resolution accuracy** - 99%+ correct business outcomes
- **Sync performance** - <2 second sync time for typical operation sets
- **Data integrity** - Zero lost reviews or progress regressions
- **Storage efficiency** - Operation storage <10x current state storage

### User Metrics  
- **Multi-device satisfaction** - Survey score >4.5/5 for multi-device users
- **Sync complaint reduction** - 95% reduction in "lost progress" support tickets
- **Cross-device usage** - 40% of users actively use 2+ devices

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Schema Implementation (2-3 days)
- **Update migration file** - Modify `000_complete_reset.sql` with property tracking fields
- **Database reset & recreate** - Drop and recreate with new schema (greenfield advantage)
- **Device fingerprinting** - Implement browser/device identification
- **LocalDB schema updates** - Add property tracking to local IndexedDB

### Phase 2: Property-Level Sync Logic (1-2 weeks)  
- **Business rule implementation** - Property-specific conflict resolution algorithms
- **Sync protocol updates** - Property-level sync instead of object replacement
- **Atomic transactions** - Ensure related properties update together
- **DataService integration** - Update existing dual-write to use property tracking

### Phase 3: Testing & Polish (3-5 days)
- **Multi-device testing** - Simulate conflicts and verify resolution
- **Performance validation** - Ensure property tracking doesn't impact speed
- **Edge case handling** - Device switching, offline scenarios
- **Monitoring setup** - Track conflict resolution success rates

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Business rule bugs** - Incorrect conflict resolution could lose user progress
- **Device fingerprinting issues** - Users clearing browser data, multiple browsers

### Medium Risk
- **Performance impact** - Additional property metadata storage and sync overhead
- **Testing complexity** - Multi-device conflict scenarios still complex to test

### Low Risk (greenfield advantages)
- âœ… **Schema migration complexity** - ELIMINATED (direct schema updates)
- âœ… **Migration timeline** - ELIMINATED (no existing data to convert)
- âœ… **Backward compatibility** - NOT NEEDED (no legacy users)
- **Implementation complexity** - Building on existing dual-write architecture
- **Storage growth** - Minimal additional data compared to full event log
- **Network overhead** - Property updates smaller than full object sync

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Database reset workflow** - Simple drop/recreate development process
- **Feature flags** - Easy disable/enable of property-level sync during development
- **Device persistence** - Store device fingerprints in localStorage + server backup
- **Comprehensive testing** - Multi-device simulation before any real users

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Enhanced Timestamp Sync (1 week)
**Pros:** Minimal implementation, very low risk  
**Cons:** Still loses data in conflicts, doesn't solve core problem
**Verdict:** Insufficient for quality multi-device experience

### Option 2: Full Event Sourcing/Tree-Based (10+ weeks)
**Pros:** Complete conflict resolution, audit trail, theoretical perfection  
**Cons:** Massive complexity, storage overhead, performance concerns
**Verdict:** Over-engineered for the problem scope - replaced by this property-level approach

### Option 3: CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) (4-6 weeks)
**Pros:** Mathematically proven conflict resolution  
**Cons:** Complex to implement business rules, limited flexibility for domain logic
**Verdict:** Academic elegance but doesn't match spaced repetition business needs

### Option 4: Server-side Locking (1 week)
**Pros:** Prevents conflicts entirely, simple implementation  
**Cons:** Breaks offline-first experience, poor UX with network issues
**Verdict:** Incompatible with offline-first architecture

## Decision Framework

### Ship Property-Level Sync If:
- **Multi-device usage >15%** of active users
- **Conflict complaints >2%** of support tickets  
- **Engineering capacity** available for 3-5 week project
- **User feedback** indicates sync issues are frustrating

### Ship Enhanced Timestamp Sync If:
- **Single-device usage** remains >90%  
- **Conflict rate <0.5%** of total reviews
- **Higher priority features** compete for engineering time
- **MVP timeline** doesn't allow for property-level implementation

## Conclusion

Property-level sync with business-aware conflict resolution provides the optimal balance of conflict resolution capability and implementation complexity. Inspired by Dexie Cloud's proven approach, this solution solves 90%+ of multi-device conflicts with 70% less complexity than event sourcing.

**Recommendation:** Implement property-level sync as primary post-MVP enhancement. The **2-3 week timeline** (reduced from 3-5 weeks due to greenfield advantages) makes this highly feasible while delivering substantial improvement in multi-device experience.

**Key Benefits:**
- Preserves user progress in conflict scenarios
- Maintains offline-first architecture  
- Builds on existing dual-write foundation
- **Greenfield advantage: No migration complexity**
- **Direct schema updates** instead of complex ALTER statements
- **Clean implementation** without legacy compatibility concerns
- Enables future advanced sync features
